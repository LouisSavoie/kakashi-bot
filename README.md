# KakashiBot

A simple Discord bot made for the testing of other bots that simply copies messages starting with the prefix `kb `.

The idea is Kakashi copies your messages and the bot your testing responds based on Kakashi's role / permissions / etc. instead of your own so you don't have to log into a different account or change your own role / permissions / etc. just for the test and then revert all that.
